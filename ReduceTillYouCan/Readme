You are given four integers a, b, a_thres and b_thres. Initially, a ≥ a_thres and b ≥ b_thres. You can do the following operation no more than n times:

Choose either a or b and decrease it by one. However, as a result of this operation, value of a cannot become less than a_thres, and value of b cannot become less than b_thres.

Thus reduce these number while you can to find the minimum product. Your task is to find the minimum possible product of a and b you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than n times.

Input Format

A single line of input containing 5 integers a, b, a_thres, b_thres, n

Constraints

All the variables a, b, a_thres, b_thres & n, as well as the minimum product all lie int range of int(32 bit).

Output Format

A single integer, which is the minimum product
