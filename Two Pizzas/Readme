Hitesh and Ayush went to a pizza shop to eat pizza. The restaurant is a bit unusual: it offers n slices of pizza aligned in a row, and a customer has to choose a continuous subsegment of these slices to buy.

The slices of pizzas are of two types: either with oregano or with chilli flakes. Let's denote the type of the ith slice from the left slice as si, where si = 1 means it is with oregano, and si = 2 means it is with chilli.

Hitesh does not like oregano and Ayush does not like chilli. They wants to choose such a continuous subsegment of slices such that it has equal number of slices of each type and each half of the subsegment has only one type of slice.

For example, subsegment [2,2,2,1,1,1] is valid, but subsegment [1,2,1,2,1,2] is not, because both halves contain both types of slices.

Print the length of the longest continuous subsegment of slices they can buy.

Example

input

7

2 2 2 1 1 2 2

Output

4

Explanation : They can choose the subsegment [2,2,1,1] or the subsegment [1,1,2,2] with length 4.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer n, the number of slices in the row.

The next line contains n integers s1, s2, ...., sn (si = 1 denoting oregano toppings or si = 2 denoting chilli toppings), representing the toppings of slices from left to right.

Constraints

2 <= n <= 10^5

si = 1 or si = 2

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)

Output Format

The only line contains a single positive integer, the length of the longest continuous subsegment of slices they can buy.
