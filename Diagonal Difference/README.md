Diagonal Difference
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix is shown below:

1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9  
The left-to-right diagonal =1+5+9=15 . The right to left diagonal = 3+5+9 = 17. Their absolute difference is |15-17| = 2.

Problem description
Complete the code in the editor.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer,n , the number of rows and columns in the square matrix .

Each of the next lines describes a row, and consists of space-separated integers .

Output:
int: the absolute diagonal difference Input Format
